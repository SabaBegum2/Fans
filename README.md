# Fans
Welcome to Java-FanModeling, a Java repository dedicated to demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts through a 
simple yet effective fan model. This repository features a Fans class that encapsulates the characteristics and functionalities 
of a fan, such as speed, color, radius, and operational status.

Key Features:

Real-World Object Modeling: The Fans class provides a practical example of how real-world objects can be modeled in Java, 
showcasing basic principles of object-oriented programming.

Customizable Fan Properties: Includes constants for different fan speeds (SLOW, MEDIUM, FAST) and allows for customization 
of properties like speed, color, radius, and operational status.

Constructor Overloading: Demonstrates the use of constructor overloading for different initialization scenarios.

Encapsulation and Access Control: Follows good practices of encapsulation with private fields and public getter and setter methods.

Method Overriding: Implements a custom toString method to provide meaningful string representations of fan objects based on their 
current state.

Interactive Main Class: The Fan main class creates instances of Fans, showcasing how objects can be manipulated and interacted with 
in a Java application.

Open to Enhancements: Contributions are welcomed, whether it's adding new features, refining the code, or improving the documentation.
Java-FanModeling is an ideal repository for beginners looking to grasp object-oriented programming in Java through a simple and relatable 
example. Join us in exploring the fundamentals of Java OOP with this engaging fan model!
